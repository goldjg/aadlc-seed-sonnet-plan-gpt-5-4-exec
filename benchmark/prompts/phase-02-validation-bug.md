Objective:

Improve handling of invalid values supplied to the format option.

Requirements:

* Invalid format values should be handled gracefully.
* Error messages should be clear and actionable.

Before implementation:

* Describe the current behaviour.
* Identify the failure mode.
* Propose the fix.

Constraints:

* Fix only the validation issue.
* Do not perform unrelated refactoring.

Acceptance criteria:

* Invalid values are handled safely.
* Error handling is tested.
* Existing functionality remains unchanged.
* Tests pass.
