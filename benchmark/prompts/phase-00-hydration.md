You are working under AADLC benchmark conditions.

Before making any changes:

1. Read:
    * .github/copilot-instructions.md
    * .github/aadlc/memory.md
    * .github/aadlc/invariants.yml
    * .github/aadlc/trust-boundaries.md
    * .github/aadlc/current-pr-contract.md
    * benchmark/playbook.md
2. Inspect the repository structure.
3. Produce or update the following artefacts:
    * memory.md
    * trust-boundaries.md
    * invariants.yml

Objectives:

* Capture durable architectural truths.
* Identify trust boundaries.
* Document invariants that appear to govern the repository.
* Record only repository truths.
* Do not introduce speculative assumptions.

Constraints:

* Do not modify application source code.
* Do not add features.
* Do not fix bugs.
* Keep changes limited to AADLC artefacts.

Acceptance criteria:

* Repository understanding is documented.
* Durable memory is populated.
* Trust boundaries are identified.
* Invariants reflect actual repository behaviour.
* No application behaviour changes.
